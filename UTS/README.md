# Deep Learning Projects: Fish Classification (CNN) & MLP Image Classifier

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating image classification using deep learning models:

1. **CNN_KlasifikasiIkan.ipynb** ‚Äì A Convolutional Neural Network for classifying types of fish.
2. **MLP_UTSTelkom.ipynb** ‚Äì A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for image classification, likely for educational or assessment purposes.

## üìÅ Files

### 1. `CNN_KlasifikasiIkan.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implements a CNN to classify different species of fish based on image data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Data preprocessing using `ImageDataGenerator`.
  - CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Training visualization with accuracy and loss curves.
  - Evaluation on validation and test data.
  - Possible use of data augmentation.

### 2. `MLP_UTSTelkom.ipynb`
- **Description**: Builds a simple feedforward neural network (MLP) for image classification.
- **Key Features**:
  - Flattened input from image data (no convolution).
  - Several dense layers with activation functions.
  - Likely part of a university assignment (UTS = Ujian Tengah Semester).
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy, loss metrics).
